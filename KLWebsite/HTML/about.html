        <h3> What Is Ayurvedic Medicine?</h3>
        <p>The ancient Indian medical system, also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a 
            “natural” and holistic approach to physical and mental health. Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world’s 
            oldest medical systems and remains one of India’s traditional health care systems. Ayurvedic treatment combines 
            products (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.</p>
